This code applies the following steps:

Convert the frame to grayscale
Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise
Apply Canny edge detection to detect edges
Mask the image to only show the region of interest
Apply Hough transform to detect lines
Draw the detected lines on a blank image
Overlay the detected lines on the original frame
Repeat the process for each frame in the video or webcam stream.
Note that the draw_lines() function simply draws the detected lines on a blank image, and the process_image() function calls this function to draw the detected lines on the original frame. You may need to adjust the parameters of the Canny edge detection and Hough transform to better detect the lane lines in your specific scenario.
